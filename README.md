# Antarctic Vim

A bleak, functional colorscheme with a splash of colour where needed.

## About

A light colour scheme designed to be functional. It is not designed to look
pretty, but rather be readable in high glare conditions, use little coloured
text (inspired by `syntax off` and semantic highlighting), and not include any
eye-straining colour/contrast combinations.

Should work out of the box for 256 colour terminals and 24bit gui/terminals.
If something doesn't look quite right, please open and issue with a description
of the problem and ideally a screenshot.

Inspired by numerous web articles about light colour themes and less colourful
syntax highlighting. I don't expect anyone else to like or use this. It's
published on GitHub so I can install it with the rest of the Vim plugins I use.
Most colour and typography choices are arbitrary and reflect my whims or
laziness.

## Installation

`:h packages` or use a package manager of your choice.


## Usage

```
:colorscheme antarctic
```


## Configuration

There is no configuration. If you want to customize the colours, you are free
to fork the repository and make changes as you wish (see development info
below). Please consider making a pull request back to the original repository
if you feel your changes may benefit the wider community.


## Development

This colour scheme is developed using
[romainl's erb template](https://github.com/romainl/vim-rnb).
Ruby must be installed (for the `erb` command).

Edit the variables in `colors/paper.erb` and run `make` to build
`colors/antarctic.vim`. `colors/antarctic.vim` should not be edited directly.
